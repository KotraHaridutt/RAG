The increase in digitalization is leading\\nto more personalized medicines and care, a more collaborative\\nenvironment and greater innovation across the industry. With\\nthese changes come unprecedented opportunities and chal-\\nlenges. These trends are creating new and different expectations\\nand demands from both customers and other stakeholders, while\\nalso generating novel sources and forms of value and competi-\\ntion for pharma. Such shifts are opening new opportunities for\\nstakeholders to improve and transform their products and ser-\\nvices, and to optimize health outcomes, quality of life and cus-\\ntomer satisfaction more effectively and equitably.\\nNavigating these changes will be crucial, because pharma\\nnot only affects the health, well-being and quality of life of\\nbillions of people, but also affects the economic and social\\ndevelopment of nations and regions. However, doing so effec-\\ntively can be challenging, because this industry is complex,\\ndynamic and highly regulated, and it involves multiple stake-\\nholders (e.g., patients, health-care providers, payers, regulators,\\nresearchers and innovators). It also draws from diverse factors,\\nsuch\\nas\\nscience,\\ntechnology,\\nregulation,\\npolicy\\nand\\nthe\\nmarket.\\nEffective navigation will require a change in perspective\\namong stakeholders of the pharmaceutical industry. The old\\n‘textbook’ in pharma, or the traditional operating model and\\nconceptual framework that has historically guided the practices\\nand strategies of the pharmaceutical industry, has revolved\\naround a model that focused on mass production, mass market-\\ning and one-size-ﬁts-all therapeutic solutions. It was largely char-\\nacterized by a linear pathway from drug discovery to market,\\nwith minimal emphasis on customization, patient engagement\\nor leveraging digital technologies for innovation and efﬁciency.\\nContinuing to follow this path will mean failing to fully take\\nadvantage of all the opportunities in this rapidly evolving\\nlandscape.\\nTherefore, the pharmaceutical industry needs to rethink its\\nprocesses by embracing and leveraging the four key dimensions\\nof change, which will serve as the chapters in this ‘rewritten text-\\nbook’ for pharma: digitalization, personalization, collaboration\\nand innovation. Within this new textbook, we present a practical\\nguide that adopts best practices and case studies from the indus-\\ntry, aiming to assist pharmaceutical companies in incorporating\\nthese essential areas into their strategic planning and operational\\nactivities (Figure 1). Instead of providing an exhaustive examina-\\ntion of each area, this article presents the transformational trends\\nin the pharmaceutical industry and provides strategic advice for\\ncapitalizing on these trends. The guide is intended to facilitate\\nthe industry’s adaptation to ongoing changes, with the ultimate\\naim of enhancing product and service offerings, optimizing pro-\\ncesses and achieving a more responsive approach to market\\ndemands.\\nChapter 1: Digitalization\\nDigitalization, the ﬁrst chapter in our rewritten textbook, is rev-\\nolutionizing not just pharma, but every industry. It is being con-\\nsidered as the ‘Fourth Industrial Revolution’ by the World\\nDrug Discovery Today\\nFIGURE 1\\nThe rewritten textbook for the pharmaceutical industry.

This revolution encompasses, but is not limited to,\\ntechnologies such as artiﬁcial intelligence (AI), big data analytics,\\ncloud computing, the Internet of Things (IoT), blockchain tech-\\nnology, quantum computing and 5G connectivity. In the phar-\\nmaceutical\\nindustry,\\nthese\\ntechnological\\nadvancements\\nfacilitate the efﬁcient processing and analysis of extensive\\nhealth-care data sets, including electronic health records (EHRs),\\ngenomic information, data from wearable technology and\\ninsights gathered from social media platforms. Leveraging such\\ndata, pharma can enhance various aspects of its value chain,\\nfrom drug discovery and development to manufacturing, distri-\\nbution, initiatives and beyond.\\nThis digital revolution is driving signiﬁcant value for pharma-\\nceutical industry. A McKinsey report underscores the substantial\\neconomic potential that digitalization holds for the pharmaceuti-\\ncal ﬁeld, estimating the generation of up to US$100 billion in value\\nannually\\n(https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/life-sciences/\\nour-insights/digital-in-r-and-d-the-100-billion-opportunity). This\\nestimate is predicated on expected enhancements in operational\\nefﬁciency, product quality and development speed. Additionally,\\nthe introduction of digital products and services is poised to create\\nnew revenue opportunities and catalyze growth within the\\nindustry.\\nThe pharmaceutical industry’s integration of data and tech-\\nnology is pivotal for increasing efﬁciency, effectiveness, innova-\\ntion and insights (i.e., data generation enabled by digital), as well\\nas improving stakeholder experience. Three transformation\\ntrends emerge from analyzing industry case studies and effective\\npractices: (i) the use of digital platforms and services; (ii) the\\nstrategic application of data analytics; and (iii) the increased\\nuse of AI and machine learning.\\nThe ﬁrst strategy, the implementation of digital platforms and\\nservices, aims to increase process efﬁciencies across the entire\\nvalue chain, improve effectiveness by improving quality in areas\\nfrom manufacturing to ﬁeld force effectiveness, and enhance\\npatient engagement and customer experience. Digital platforms\\nand services geared towards improving patient engagement and\\ncustomer experience, for example, involve the provision of digi-\\ntal aids that allow patients to manage their conditions, track\\ntheir symptoms and communicate with health-care profession-\\nals, while also making medication more accessible and afford-\\nable. An example of this strategy is Novartis’ initiation of the\\nNovartis Biome (https://www.biome.novartis.com), which aims\\nto foster partnerships with digital health start-ups to create digi-\\ntal solutions addressing health-care gaps. One successful product\\nof this initiative is SMS for Life, a mobile application designed to\\nincrease the accessibility and reduce the cost of crucial medicines\\nin regions with low and middle incomes by utilizing SMS tech-\\nnology for managing inventory and pricing at health facilities\\n(see\\nhttps://www.novartis.com/sites/novartis_com/ﬁles/novar-\\ntis-social-business-report-2018.pdf).\\nThe second strategy recommends the utilization of data and\\nanalytics to drive innovation and insights, to create new computa-\\ntional models and to enhance patient care. Enhancing patient\\ncare, for example, involves providing data-driven insights and\\nsolutions that support the decision-making processes of patients,\\nhealth-care providers and payers. It also includes measuring and\\ndemonstrating the value and impact of the industry’s products\\nand services. An example of this approach is Roche’s acquisition\\nof Flatiron Health (https://www.ﬁercehealthcare.com/ehr/roche-\\nﬂatiron-health-1-9b), which specializes in oncology-speciﬁc EHR\\nsoftware and data analytics. Roche’s objective is to augment per-\\nsonalized and value-based health care in the oncology industry\\nby applying Flatiron’s proﬁciency in real-world data to generate\\nevidence thatinﬂuences clinicaldecisions,researchandregulatory\\nand reimbursement policies for cancer-care products and services.\\nDrug Discovery Today\\nFIGURE 2\\nUse cases of AI and machine learning in each section of the pharma value chain.

These emerg-\\ning technologies not only have the potential to enhance the\\nother strategies described above, but also inﬂuence all aspects\\nof the pharma industry, from drug discovery and development\\nto commercialization and patient care (Figure 2). AI systems,\\nthrough the analysis of extensive data sets, such as multi-omics\\n(e.g., genomics and proteomics), enable the extraction of previ-\\nously unobtainable insights.(p1) The essence of AI involves mak-\\ning decisions based on the data it has been trained on, meaning\\nthat the quality of its output is directly related to the quality of\\nthe input data (see https://www.purestorage.com/knowledge/\\nwhat-is-ai-inference.html). Furthermore, rather than replacing\\njobs, AI is set to reshape roles within the industry. For example,\\nAI is already assisting doctors in rapidly identifying brain tumors,\\nwhich could eventually lead to tumor identiﬁcation during sur-\\ngery, allowing doctors to adjust their strategy in real time.(p2)\\nThe impact of AI and machine learning technology has the\\npotential to extend throughout the pharmaceutical value chain,\\nenhancing processes from the initial discovery phase to the ﬁnal\\nstages of health-care administration.\\nAt the discovery level, AI is already starting to facilitate the\\nidentiﬁcation of new treatments by analyzing the interactions\\nbetween different therapeutic approaches and their targets,\\nincluding the characterization of human physiological attributes\\nfrom the cells to organs, with the potential of identifying new\\ndisease biomarkers.(p3) Although the use of biomarkers for oncol-\\nogy is more advanced than for other indications, their use for\\ntreating any disease is still very complex, particularly for diseases\\nin which multiple genes have a role. AI has the potential to\\nimprove identiﬁcation and increase the rates of clinical success.\\nFor example, the general machine learning model Stabl has been\\ndesigned to mitigate the substantial risk of failing to validate ret-\\nrospective data in prospective clinical studies by applying\\nsparsity-promoting regularization, thereby distilling data sets\\ncontaining 1,400–35,000 features down to 4–34 candidate\\nbiomarkers.(p4)\\nThe use of AI during discovery could result in greater success\\nrates in clinical trials. When used in the ﬁeld of epidemiology,\\nit could also aid in dissecting tissue inﬂammation and disease\\nsusceptibility patterns, improving diagnostic capabilities. In the\\nclinic, AI has the potential to streamline regulatory processes\\nsuch as trial enrollment and tracking, as well as the completion\\nof regulatory documents such as clinical study reports (CSRs).\\nThe latter was tested as part of a challenge initiated by Pﬁzer,\\nin which participants used generative AI to create safety tables\\nfor CSRs.(p5) The results revealed that, although there is potential\\nfor large language models (LLMs) to automate the summarization\\nof tables in CSRs, there is still a need for human involvement and\\ncontinued research to optimize this technology.\\nAI and machine learning have the potential to affect pharma-\\nceutical manufacturing by streamlining the procurement process\\nthrough advanced sourcing strategies, thereby enhancing efﬁ-\\nciency and reducing operational costs. AI-driven virtual assis-\\ntants\\ncould\\nenable\\npredictive\\nmaintenance\\nand\\noperation\\noptimization, which could markedly increase overall equipment\\nefﬁciency. In terms of quality management, advanced AI systems\\ncould facilitate automated deviation investigations, thereby\\nimproving both productivity and regulatory adherence. AI-\\nenabled strategies, such as no-touch planning and real-time\\ninventory management, could also signiﬁcantly advance supply\\nchain operations by predicting demand ﬂuctuations and opti-\\nmizing inventory levels accordingly.\\nAnother powerful application of machine learning and AI lies\\nin predicting wastage of active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs).\\nBy analyzing material science and process data, AI technologies\\ncan identify potential inefﬁciencies and bottlenecks throughout\\nthe supply chain. Leveraging these insights, the system can sug-\\ngest process adjustments to mitigate wastage. This capability can\\ndrastically cut costs (see https://nexocode.com/blog/posts/artiﬁ-\\ncial-intelligence-in-api-manufacturing). For instance, achieving\\na more than 30% reduction in API loss during the manufacture\\nof oral medications could result in savings of tens of millions\\nof dollars annually, offering a substantial improvement over\\nexisting procedures.\\nIn the realm of commercialization, AI’s capability to automate\\ncustomer interactions and personalize marketing strategies has\\nthe potential to signiﬁcantly elevate the customer experience\\nand provide marketing insights. This technology offers a reﬁned\\nperspective on consumer behavior, enabling precise marketing\\ncommunications. Marketing initiatives will also gain from the\\ninsights derived through AI analysis of social media engage-\\nments, facilitating immediate consumer interaction. In patient\\ncare, AI can transform the way diagnoses are made and treatment\\noutcomes are measured, ensuring personalized treatment plans\\nare devised according to individual patient proﬁles. Prospective\\nmodels might even adapt treatments to match patients’ unique\\ngenetic and lifestyle characteristics. However, it should be noted\\nthat there are privacy concerns among patients regarding the use\\nof customer data (e.g., health data and lifestyle analytics) in\\nhealth care and therapy. Although some countries have imple-\\nmented comprehensive regulation to ensure protection of per-\\nsonal data and privacy, such as the European Union’s General\\nData Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the European Health\\nData Space (EHDS), low levels of trust in institutions could make\\npatients reluctant to share data.(p6) This, in turn, could limit the\\nuse of AI for commercialization and marketing, and could reduce\\nthe amount of data available to support AI-driven research.\\nAI and machine learning are also set to change how the phar-\\nmaceutical industry conducts research. For example, AI team\\nlead (ATL) is an emerging job role in pharma that entails leverag-\\ning AI technologies to enhance aspects such as drug discovery\\nand development processes, with the aim of improving patient\\noutcomes and streamlining pharmaceutical research. ATLs col-\\nlaborate with AI, overseeing the entire life cycle of an AI-driven\\ndrug-discovery program, ensuring data quality and the align-\\nment of the model with research goals, and clearly communicat-\\ning the ﬁndings.\\nSome companies are already adopting the idea of AI-driven\\nresearch, particularly in oncology.

Through this application of AI, individ-\\nuals will gain unparalleled access to expansive online data sets,\\noffering deep insights that were previously difﬁcult to obtain.\\nAICs will also allow patients to forge digital connections, facili-\\ntating the exchange of experiences and fostering a shared under-\\nstanding of health-care journeys. Furthermore, through AICs,\\npublic and private organizations are anticipated to collaborate\\nin building common data libraries, merging public data with pro-\\nprietary in-house information.\\nThe digital revolution in the pharmaceutical industry could\\nalso expand what we consider to be human. The concept of a\\n‘digital human’ introduces a revolutionary idea, bridging the\\ngap between technological innovation and human identity. AI\\nproviders (AIPs), for example, are systems that leverage AI to sup-\\nport diagnostic, treatment and care management decisions.\\nCompanies have already begun to embrace the idea of AIPs,\\nincluding Nvidia and Hippocratic AI, which have employed\\ndigital nurses to handle low-risk calls and alleviate some of the\\nburden on the health-care system (see https://www.businessin-\\nsider.com/nvidia-ai-nurses-treat-patients-2024-3). Several clinical\\ntrials have also found that voice-based digital assistants could\\npotentially supplement initiatives to promote transitional care,\\nphysical activity, smoking cessation and medication adherence\\nin patients with cardiovascular disease.(p7)\\nIn the future, with improvements to these models, we might\\nbe able to build a digital workforce that can provide personalized\\nsupport, including language and accents tailored to the patient\\nand support for patients with speech and neurological impair-\\nments that would serve to improve equity and accessibility of\\ncare. They can also be used to both diagnose and treat those with\\npsychiatric diseases.(p8) We might even be able to preserve a\\nperson’s digital legacy for future generations to interact with\\nand\\nlearn\\nfrom\\n(see\\nhttps://erictopol.substack.com/p/sid-\\nmukherjee-on-ai-longevity-and). However, for interactions with\\nthese ‘digital people’ to feel natural, there would need to be a\\ntransition away from speech-text-speech models (see https://\\nhuggingface.co/learn/audio-course/chapter7/speech-to-speech)\\nto true-speech LLMs, in which speech is converted directly to\\nspeech. Such true-speech technologies are emerging in the tech\\nindustry, such as Alexa’s new automatic-speech-recognition\\n(ASR)\\nmodel\\n(see\\nhttps://www.amazon.science/blog/alexa-\\nunveils-new-speech-recognition-text-to-speech-technologies).\\nChapter 1.2: Navigating the digital revolution\\nThe transition towards digitalization heralds both signiﬁcant\\nopportunities and signiﬁcant challenges for the pharmaceutical\\nindustry. It enables the exploration of emerging markets such\\nas digital health, e-pharmacy and telemedicine, while introduc-\\ning disruptive elements that transform the competitive arena\\nand alter consumer expectations. The rise of new and diverse\\nmarkets has also driven the entry of unconventional competi-\\ntors, including technology corporations, start-ups and non-\\ngovernmental organizations (NGOs), each bringing innovative\\nhealth solutions and creating new competitive pressures for tra-\\nditional pharmaceutical companies.\\nAdapting to this evolving landscape demands a re-evaluation\\nof how digital tools are utilized to enhance both the efﬁciency\\nand effectiveness of the pharmaceutical industry’s operations\\nand offerings. There is an imperative need for innovation in pro-\\nduct and service delivery that embraces a data-driven, evidence-\\nbased and customer-centric approach. Therefore, the industry\\nmust consider how it can reinvent its structural model and value\\nproposition by leveraging technological advancements and data\\nanalytics. Drawing on the initiatives outlined previously, it is\\nclear that by adopting digital technologies, the pharmaceutical\\nindustry can develop strategies to harness the beneﬁts of digital-\\nization while addressing associated risks.\\nIn the current era of digital evolution, the pharmaceutical\\nindustry should adopt digital technologies while also preparing\\nfor the associated ethical, legal, organizational and technical\\nchallenges.

Beyond the adoption of new\\ntechnologies, the industry must also address and minimize the\\nrisks associated with digitalization, ensuring that the transition\\noccurs in a manner that is both responsible and ethical, protect-\\ning the interests of consumers and society at large.\\nChapter 2: Personalization\\nDigitalization is enhancing personalization in health care, shift-\\ning away from the conventional population-based approach and\\ntowards an individualized paradigm. The use of multi-omics data\\nand AI, for example, is enabling the processing and understand-\\ning of intricate biological information on an unprecedented\\nscale.(p10) Such large-scale data analysis is leading to a rise in per-\\nsonalized medicine, which takes into account the speciﬁc\\ngenetic, disease and lifestyle characteristics of patients.(p11) This\\nis particularly true when this data-driven approach is coupled\\nwith synthetic biology (the engineering of complex biological\\nsystems) and the advancement of gene therapy and other\\nbiotechnology ﬁelds.\\nThe ﬁeld of personalized medicine is growing. According to\\nthe Personalized Medicine Coalition (https://www.personali-\\nzedmedicinecoalition.org/Userﬁles/PMC-Corporate/ﬁle/PM_at_FDA_\\nThe_Scope_and_Signiﬁcance_of_Progress_in_2019.pdf),\\nthe\\nproportion of FDA-approved personalized medicines has esca-\\nlated from 5% of total approvals in 2005 to 42% in 2019, with\\nexpected\\ncontinuous growth.\\nThe market\\nfor\\npersonalized\\nmedicine is projected to grow from $300 billion in 2021 to\\n$870\\nbillion\\nin\\n2031\\n(see\\nhttps://www.alliedmarketre-\\nsearch.com/personalized-medicine-market-A13388). This growth\\ncan be seen in the substantial advancements that have been real-\\nized in personalized medicine, in both the oncology and non-\\noncology domains. In oncology, this means being able to target\\nspeciﬁc mutations within a tumor. Palbociclib, for example, has\\ndemonstrated efﬁcacy in the treatment of ER+ and HER2- breast\\ntumors, while encorafenib, in conjunction with cetuximab, has\\nshown effectiveness in patients with colorectal cancer harboring\\nBRAF V600E mutations.(p12),(p13) In non-oncology contexts, per-\\nsonalized therapeutic strategies for type 2 diabetes are meticu-\\nlously tailored to correspond with the patient’s stage within\\nthe diabetes continuum, addressing distinct issues such as insu-\\nlin\\nresistance\\nor\\ndeﬁciency.(p14)\\nTherapeutic\\ninterventions\\ndesigned to help manage rheumatoid arthritis are also increas-\\ningly individualized on the basis of factors such as age, sex, dis-\\nease activity and genetic predispositions.(p15)\\nThere are several factors contributing to the rise of personal-\\nized medicine, one of the largest being the transition to big data\\nand digitalization, which is accelerating the pace and compre-\\nhensiveness of personalized medicine, allowing for more precise\\nand individualized treatment plans. It is also being driven by an\\nincreasing need for personalized medicine strategies to address\\ncomplex diseases (e.g., genetic disorders). For instance, gene ther-\\napies could be designed to rectify defective genes that cause rare\\nand previously untreatable conditions, and vaccines are now\\nbeing designed using neoantigens, which elicit an immune\\nresponse that attacks cancer cells speciﬁc to an individual’s\\ntumor.(p16) These strategies have the potential to enhance treat-\\nment effectiveness, safety and cost-efﬁciency, while reducing\\nthe impact of chronic and rare diseases.\\nThe pharmaceutical industry is advancing this ﬁeld through\\nthe integration of various technologies and methodologies to\\ndevelop treatments tailored to the individual genetic and molec-\\nular proﬁles of patients. A notable example is Pﬁzer’s develop-\\nment\\nof\\nVitrakvi\\n(larotrectinib),\\na\\ntherapy\\ntargeting\\nthe\\nneurotrophic tropomyosin receptor kinase (NTRK) gene fusion\\nin different tumor types, identiﬁed through biomarkers rather\\nthan the location of the tumor.(p17) Vitrakvi was shown to shrink\\nor stop 75% of the tumors and to get rid of 22% of them in\\npatients with NTRK gene fusion-positive tumors across different\\nages, tumor types and previous treatments. Novartis leads in the\\ngene\\nreplacement\\nﬁeld\\nwith\\nZolgensma\\n(onasemnogene\\nabeparvovec-xioi), a gene therapy for spinal muscular atrophy,\\na severe neuromuscular disorder in infants and children (see\\nhttps://www.novartis.com/news/media-releases/novartis-presents-\\nnew-data-safety-and-efﬁcacy-zolgensma-including-maintained-\\nand-improved-motor-milestones-older-and-heavier-children-sma).\\nZolgensma works by replacing the malfunctioning survival\\nmotor neuron (SMN) gene with a functional variant, providing\\na one-time treatment that has demonstrated the ability to halt\\ndisease progression and enhance patient prognosis.\\nAdvancements in biotechnology and synthetic biology, espe-\\ncially using DNA and RNA technology, are facilitating the emer-\\ngence of novel treatments for complex and individualized\\ndiseases such as cancer, which varies from person to person even\\nwithin cancer types. Merck, for example, is developing V940, a\\nnovel mRNA-based individualized neoantigen therapy, with\\nModerna\\n(see\\nhttps://www.merck.com/news/merck-and-mod-\\nerna-initiate-phase-3-study-evaluating-v940-mrna-4157-in-com-\\nbination-with-keytruda-pembrolizumab-for-adjuvant-treatment-\\nof-patients-with-resected-high-riskstage-iib-iv-melanom).\\nThis\\ntherapy, consisting of a single synthetic mRNA coding for up\\nto 34 neoantigens, is designed and produced based on the\\nunique mutational signature of the DNA sequence of the\\npatient’s tumor.\\nThe move towards personalized therapeutics also alters the\\nroles of health-care providers, patients and payers, necessitating\\nsmaller, more adaptable and tailored clinical trials, as well as\\nthe formulation of new end points and evidence.

Pharmaceutical\\ncompanies are often hesitant to invest in therapies for rare con-\\nditions, such as certain retinal dystrophies, owing to the high\\ndevelopment costs and uncertain returns. Demonstrating the\\nefﬁcacy of these therapies through prospective trials with such\\nsmall target populations further compounds these challenges.\\nThere are also challenges in commercializing personalized\\nmedicines. Multiple drugs might need to be combined, which,\\nin turn, could lower sales or increase costs. To achieve the eco-\\nnomic viability of personalized medicine, it is essential to focus\\non improving R&D efﬁciency through targeted enhancements,\\nsuch as better success rates and reduced cycle times.(p18) Cus-\\ntomized strategies tailored to each company’s speciﬁc needs,\\nalong with data-driven decision-making, can further optimize\\nthe development process.(p18). Additionally, collaborations with\\nexternal partners can help to distribute the risks and costs.(p18)\\nHowever, the exact level of R&D productivity required for per-\\nsonalized medicine to be economically viable is still uncertain.\\nOn the other end of the pharma value chain, the rise of digi-\\ntalization and AI is revolutionizing how personalized content for\\nmarketing drug products is produced.(p19) The shift towards\\nautomating and tailoring content creation will transition mar-\\nketing strategies away from a population-based approach to\\none that emphasizes individualized communications. AI’s role\\nin optimizing the content generation process signiﬁcantly ele-\\nvates efﬁciency by minimizing the time and resources dedicated\\nto crafting promotional assets, thereby fostering engagements\\nthat are more precisely attuned to the speciﬁc needs and prefer-\\nences of health-care providers and patients. This development\\nsigniﬁcantly advances the shift towards more personalized\\nhealth care, enabling marketing initiatives to be closely aligned\\nwith individual or group-speciﬁc health-care requirements.\\nIn application, AI-powered tools are adept at analyzing exten-\\nsive data sets to delineate distinct patient proﬁles and ascertain\\nthe most impactful communication tactics for varied demo-\\ngraphics. For example, leveraging insights gained from an analy-\\nsis\\nof\\na\\npatient’s\\ngenetic\\nmakeup,\\ndisease\\ncondition\\nand\\ntreatment trajectory, AI can produce individualized educational\\ncontent or medication instructions. Such advancements not\\nonly improve patient engagement and compliance, but also\\ncoordinate marketing activities with the principal objective of\\nproviding tailored health-care services. The effects of these tech-\\nnological advancements promise to substantially boost market-\\ning efﬁciency and accuracy and dramatically lower the costs\\nassociated with content production, with one report projecting\\na more than 20% acceleration in marketing campaign execution\\nspeeds (see https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/life-sciences/\\nour-insights/generative-ai-in-the-pharmaceutical-industry-mov-\\ning-from-hype-to-reality). This shift not only marks a transition\\nto a more patient-oriented marketing model in the pharmaceuti-\\ncal sector, but also highlights the crucial role of digital innova-\\ntion in improving the precision and operational performance\\nof health-care communications.\\nCompanies are already starting to use generative AI to create\\npersonalized marketing content for consumers. Novartis, for\\nexample, uses its Biome initiative (https://www.biome.novar-\\ntis.com), a network of digital innovation labs that focus on lever-\\naging AI and data analytics, to tailor patient engagement.\\nThrough the analysis of extensive data sets, Novartis can tailor\\nits marketing content and educational materials to address the\\nspeciﬁc requirements of diverse patient groups and health-care\\nprofessionals.\\nNonetheless, as described in Chapter 1.1, the shift towards\\npersonalization comes with challenges, including ethical and\\nlegal issues around data privacy and consent, alongside the need\\nfor a cultural and organizational pivot within the pharmaceutical\\nindustry towards innovation and digitalization.\\nChapter 2.1: Strategies for navigating the evolution towards\\npersonalized medicine\\nIn reviewing the strategies employed by Pﬁzer, Novartis and\\nRoche, it becomes evident that the pharmaceutical industry is\\nencountering a pivotal shift towards personalized medicine. This\\nevolution, similar to the preceding shift towards digitalization,\\nnecessitates the adoption of cutting-edge technologies, method-\\nologies and paradigms, including the application of multi-omics\\nand AI to devise treatments tailored to the unique needs of indi-\\nvidual patients. This means that the successful realization of this\\npotential is contingent upon the execution of several key\\ndirectives.\\nTo start with, regulatory frameworks must be updated to\\nreﬂect the rapid pace of technological progress in the ﬁeld of per-\\nsonalized medicine. Regulatory agencies need to streamline the\\napproval processes for targeted treatments, preserving patient\\nsafety while accommodating innovative clinical trial designs\\nfocused on niche patient demographics and incorporating\\nreal-world data. The FDA is making strides in this direction\\nthrough its draft guidance, ‘Platform Technology Designation\\nProgram for Drug Development’ (https://www.fda.gov/media/\\n178928/download). This new guidance aims to accelerate the\\ndevelopment and approval of products leveraging novel plat-\\nform technologies such as mRNA. By providing expedited devel-\\nopment timelines, enhanced regulatory support and streamlined\\nreview processes, the Platform Technology Development pro-\\ngram is crucial for advancing personalized medicines, many of\\nwhich will be developed using platform technologies.

Clear commu-\\nnication regarding the advantages and constraints of these treat-\\nments is necessary to foster a comprehensive understanding of\\ntheir implications for health-care delivery.\\nBy incorporating these strategic recommendations, pharma\\ncompanies can mitigate the challenges and risks associated with\\nthe shift towards personalized medicine and fully harness the\\ncapabilities of customized treatments. Personalization might\\nnot only be a solution to many current, hard-to-treat conditions,\\nbut also a signiﬁcant opportunity for the industry to recalibrate\\nits role, improve patient outcomes and position itself at the fore-\\nfront of health-care innovation.\\nAIPs, which represent the future in the interface between\\nhealth-care providers and the technology that underpins person-\\nalized medicine, encapsulate many of these recommendations.\\nUsing AIPs, health-care payers will be able to establish metrics\\nfor improved health outcomes and economics, delineating a\\nnew paradigm in value-based care. Simultaneously, academic\\nphysician scientists will develop algorithms that integrate multi-\\nple risk factors across major diseases, aiming to extend healthy\\nliving and prevent the progression of diseases in an aging popu-\\nlation. Physicians, using the information compiled by both\\nhealth-care payers and academic physicians, and leveraging AIPs,\\nwill aim to personalize treatments to get better outcomes, more\\ncost-effective care and improved adherence to care plans. With\\nmore physicians prescribing personalized medicine, pharmaceu-\\ntical companies will be compelled to optimize their product data\\nsets, positioning themselves favorably in a new world dominated\\nby AI, in which patients, physicians and payers will use AIPs to\\nmine for the best, patient-speciﬁc medical solutions. Through\\nthis collaborative and technologically advanced approach, the\\npromise of personalized medicine is closer to becoming a reality.\\nChapter 3: Collaboration\\nThat brings us to the third chapter in our rewritten textbook: col-\\nlaboration. Although this is nothing new in the pharmaceutical\\nindustry, the shift towards digitalization and personalization will\\nrequire collaboration among previously siloed departments and\\nindustries. Therefore, to ensure efﬁcient delivery of pharmaceuti-\\ncals to consumers, there needs to be collaboration among drug\\nmanufacturers,\\npayers,\\nphysicians\\nand\\ntheir\\npatients.\\nThis\\nrequirement for cooperation is particularly evident in areas such\\nas the adult vaccine market, which could potentially see the\\nentry of 100 new products in the next decade.(p20) Navigating\\nthis signiﬁcant rise in product volume, and ensuring that\\npatients receive the vaccines needed, will require coordination\\nacross vaccine recommendation agencies (e.g., the Advisory\\nCommittee on Immunization Practices of the US Centers for Dis-\\nease Control and Prevention), those responsible for stocking the\\nvaccines and those who administer the vaccines.\\nThe pharmaceutical industry, especially in oncology, is\\nincreasingly fostering collaborations to leverage new scientiﬁc\\nand technological advancements. These partnerships, spanning\\nfrom pre-competitive consortia to focused collaborations, are\\ncrucial for combining expertise and capabilities to effectively\\naddress patient needs. For cell therapy-based oncology, notewor-\\nthy progress has emerged through the US National Institute of\\nHealth’s Partnership for Accelerating Cancer Therapies (PACT),\\nwhich\\nbrought\\ntogether\\n11\\npharmaceutical\\ncompanies\\nto\\naccelerate the development of new cancer immunotherapies\\n(see\\nhttps://pharmaphorum.com/views-analysis-oncology/the-\\nnew-pharma-collaborations-driving-transformative-research-in-\\noncology).\\nCollaborative initiatives to align the requirements of health\\ntechnology assessment (HTA) bodies and regulatory authorities\\nare also gaining momentum.(p21) This push for alignment seeks\\nto streamline regulatory processes and reimbursement pathways,\\nultimately enhancing patient care, fostering innovation and\\nenhancing health-care system sustainability. Surveys indicate\\nthat both regulatory bodies and HTA organizations are increas-\\ningly involved in formal and informal interactions across the\\nproduct life cycle, a crucial step in developing more efﬁcacious\\nand high-quality therapies.\\nAdditionally, the pharmaceutical sector is embracing collabo-\\nrative operational models to tackle challenges such as patent\\nexpiration and the complex regulatory environment. Companies\\nare forging partnerships, even with competitors, driven by\\ntechnological advancements that revolutionize health-care deliv-\\nery and drug discovery. For example, major pharmaceutical play-\\ners\\nsuch\\nas\\nBoehringer\\nIngelheim\\nare\\ncapitalizing\\non\\ncollaborations with technology companies including IBM to\\nleverage supercomputing and AI to boost antibody drug discov-\\nery efforts\\n(see\\nhttps://www.ﬁercebiotech.com/biotech/boehringer-plugs-\\nibm-trained-ai-model-boost-antibody-drug-discovery-efforts).\\nThese examples demonstrate the pharmaceutical industry’s\\ncapacity to utilize diverse collaborative ecosystems to amplify\\ninnovation and more effectively address health-care challenges.\\nBy adopting these collaborative models, the industry is poised\\nto contribute signiﬁcantly to a healthier future.\\nChapter 3.1: Embracing collaborative ecosystems for\\ninnovation\\nTo navigate the digital revolution and advanced personalization\\nin pharma, a collaborative approach is required. Drawing from\\nthe trends observed in industry, this means leveraging third-\\nparty innovation, forming strategic partnerships and initiating\\nprojects with a social impact to propel innovation and extend\\nthe utility of traditional pharmaceutical products.\\nHowever,\\nalthough\\ncollaboration\\nin\\nthe\\npharmaceutical\\nindustry is nothing new, the tools and processes enabled by AI\\nprovide novel opportunities, offering seamless collaboration that\\nwas previously unattainable. In the past, pharmaceutical process\\ntypically involved discrete areas or functions within an organiza-\\ntion working on their part of a problem or process, and then\\npassing it along in a linear fashion. Now, there is the ability to\\nwork in parallel, allowing for marketing and regulatory depart-\\nments, for example, to start working on the same material simul-\\ntaneously. This evolution could fundamentally change how we\\nstructure and approach problems.\\nFOUNDATION (PURPLE)\\nFOUNDATION (PURPLE)\\nDrug Discovery Today d Volume 29, Number 9 d September 2024\\n8\\nwww.drugdiscoverytoday.com'),\n",

The acceleration\\nof workﬂows driven by digital technologies will require collabo-\\nration across various organizational divisions, embodying a\\nholistic approach in which discovery, commercial and supply\\nchain teams can work together. For instance, advancing person-\\nalized medicines demands close cooperation between scientists\\nin discovery and development alongside those in commercial\\nstrategies and supply chain logistics. This ensures that innovative\\ntherapies can be developed and efﬁciently delivered to the appro-\\npriate patients at the right time.\\nThere also needs to be cooperation among previously distinct\\norganizations. The entry of technology ﬁrms, start-ups and non-\\nproﬁt organizations is notably altering the dynamic of the phar-\\nmaceutical industry.

Genetic sequencing the non-\\nresponders revealed two polymorphisms in the C5 gene. The ﬁrst\\npolymorphism was found in 3% of the Japanese population, and\\nthe second polymorphism was found in one Argentinian patient\\nof Asian descent. The polymorphisms in the C5 gene were\\nlocated in the region where eculizumab binds, which renders\\neculizumab unable to bind to the C5 protein. Here, we present\\nan overview of the current and potential future applications of\\neculizumab, as well as the disadvantages of eculizumab treat-\\nment in patients with C5 polymorphisms.\\nIndications and clinical use\\nParoxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria\\nThe primary and initial indication of eculizumab is the treatment\\nof the life-threatening blood disease PNH. The prevalence of this\\nultra rare disease in the USA varied from 12 to 13 cases per\\n1 000 000 people, and its mean age of diagnosis was found to\\nbe 50 years.(p2) PNH is a complement-system-mediated disease\\nthat causes excessive hemolysis, caused by a deﬁciency in regula-\\ntory complement proteins.(p3) The vast majority of cases are\\ncaused by a somatic mutation in the PIGA gene of a hematopoi-\\netic stem cell, which is responsible for the synthesis of the cell\\nsurface protein anchor glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI).(p4)\\nThe absence of the GPI anchor protein results in a lack of inhibi-\\ntory complement proteins CD55 and CD59, along with a variety\\nof other proteins. CD55 functions by limiting the excessive\\ncleavage of C3 in the complement system, and the reduction\\nin this inhibitory protein results in the increased activation of\\ndownstream complement components. CD59 acts as a defense\\nmechanism, inhibiting the formation of the MAC to protect cells\\nfrom MAC-mediated damage. These proteins ensure precise\\nimmune responses while protecting healthy cells from unin-\\ntended harm.(p5) In PNH patients, the deﬁciency of CD55 results\\nin excessive C3 convertase proteins that then activate comple-\\nment factors C3 and C5 and initiate the formation of MACs.\\nThe lack of CD59 results in the unchecked formation of MACs\\non the PNH erythrocytes and ultimately causes hemolysis of\\nthe blood cells.(p6),(p7) Although PNH is a chronic disease, the\\ndegree of hemolysis is often exacerbated by stress, trauma or\\ninﬂammation.(p6)\\nWithout adequate treatment of complement inhibitors, the\\n10-year survival rate of PNH patients is 65% and the main\\ncomplications arising from the condition are pancytopenia and\\nthrombosis.\\nCorticosteroids\\nreduce\\nhemolysis\\nin\\nvarious\\npatients, but this treatment causes long-term toxicity.(p8) In\\n2007, eculizumab was approved for treatment of PNH, and this\\nhas signiﬁcantly improved patient survival rates up to a similar\\nlevel of the survival rate of the general population.(p9),(p10) This\\nhigh efﬁcacy is achieved by the binding of eculizumab to the\\nC5 complement which enables the blocking of the damaging\\ncomplement system cascade.(p11) Treatment with eculizumab\\nimproves the hematological response signiﬁcantly in 63% of\\npatients, such that no blood transfusions are required any-\\nmore.(p12) Additionally, eculizumab was found to signiﬁcantly\\nimprove renal function in PNH patients with chronic kidney\\ndisease (CKD) stages 1–4.(p13)\\nAtypical hemolytic uremic syndrome\\nThe ultra-rare disease aHUS is a type of complement-mediated\\nthrombotic microangiopathy (TMA), and it is primarily caused\\nby dysregulation of the complement system. It is even rarer than\\nPNH with a prevalence of ﬁve per 1 000 000 in the general pop-\\nulation and, although the disease is found in all age groups, 40%\\nof patients develop aHUS before the age of 18.(p14),(p15) In aHUS,\\nthe complement system is overactivated, leading to uncontrolled\\ninﬂammation, blood vessel damage and a cascade of destructive\\nevents, particularly in the kidneys. Excessive activity of the\\nimmune system in aHUS emerges owing to a dysregulation in\\nthe complement system. The function of complement regulatory\\nproteins can be compromised either through loss-of-function\\nmutations in genes such as complement factor H (CFH), CFI,\\ncluster\\nof differentiation\\n46\\n(CD46)\\nand\\nthrombomodulin\\n(THBD) or the function of the complement system can be stim-\\nulated\\nby\\ngain-of-function\\nmutations\\nin\\nthe\\nCFB\\nor\\nC3\\ngenes.(p16),(p17),(p18),(p19),(p20) The presentation of aHUS shares\\nkey clinical features with typical infection-related HUS, including\\nmicroangiopathic hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia and\\nacute kidney failure. However, aHUS can also lead to more-\\nsevere complications like CNS abnormalities, including altered\\nconsciousness, seizures or focal neurologic deﬁcits, peripheral\\ngangrene,\\ndilated\\ncardiomyopathy\\nor\\ncardiorespiratory\\narrest.(p16),(p19),(p21) Although aHUS is a rare condition, when it\\nis triggered some common factors associated with its develop-\\nment include infections with H1N1, varicella and cytomegalo-\\nvirus\\nor\\ndiarrheal\\nillnesses\\ncaused\\nby\\na\\nnorovirus\\nor\\nbacteria.(p22),(p23),(p24) Other triggers include certain medications,\\ncancer or pregnancy.(p16),(p25)\\nHistorically, aHUS was treated with plasma exchanges or infu-\\nsions and it was linked to high rates of morbidity and mortal-\\nity.(p26)\\nHowever,\\nplasma\\nexchanges\\ndo\\nnot\\naffect\\nthe\\nunderlying problem, merely maintaining hematological parame-\\nters. In 2011, eculizumab was approved by the FDA and EMA for\\naHUS treatment and this signiﬁcantly improved patient lives by\\ninhibiting the underlying mechanism of aHUS. The ﬁrst trials of\\neculizumab for aHUS observed up to 94% of trial participants dis-\\ncontinuing plasma exchanges or infusions, indicating a great\\nimprovement over historical treatment options.(p27) A prospec-\\ntive study of pediatric patients demonstrated that plasma\\nexchanges\\nor\\ninfusions\\nwere\\nsuperﬂuous\\nafter\\neculizumab\\nKEYNOTE (GREEN)\\nKEYNOTE (GREEN)\\nDrug Discovery Today d Volume 29, Number 9 d September 2024\\n2\\nwww.drugdiscoverytoday.com'),\n",

Its prevalence is estimated at 150 to 200 cases per\\n1 000 000 individuals worldwide.(p30) It commonly emerges in\\nadulthood, with a bimodal age distribution in women peaking\\nat 30 and 50 years old. The incidence of the disease in males con-\\nstantly increases with age, with most cases between 60 and\\n89 years of age.(p31) MG is characterized by IgG autoantibodies\\nthat are targeting components of the neuromuscular junction,\\nparticularly\\nacetylcholine\\nreceptors\\n(AChR),\\nmuscle-speciﬁc\\nkinase\\n(MuSK)\\nor\\nlipoprotein-receptor-related\\nprotein\\n4\\n(LRP4).(p32),(p33),(p34) The main mechanism in AChR-antibody-\\npositive (Ab+) patients is the binding of the antibody to the\\nAChR protein causing the activation of the complement cascade,\\nleading to the formation of the MACs, and ultimately damaging\\nthe postsynaptic membrane and degrading of the synaptic folds,\\nincluding voltage-gated sodium channels.(p35) This leads to\\nreduced postsynaptic potential and muscle ﬁber depolarization\\nmanifesting itself in muscle weakness and fatigue. The mecha-\\nnism of MuSK Ab+ MG patients is different because MuSK anti-\\nbodies are functionally monovalent, meaning that they cannot\\ncrosslink antigens of similar classes. This results in the MuSK\\nantibodies not activating the complement system but merely\\nblocking the phosphorylation of the protein and disrupting the\\nAgrin-Lrp4-MuSK-Dok-7 signaling pathway.(p36) The mechanism\\nof MG patients with anti-LRP4 antibodies is also suggested to\\noperate by blocking MuSK activation; but because these antibod-\\nies belong to the IgG1 subclass they are also able to activate the\\ncomplement system.(p37),(p38) Because the mechanisms of AChR\\nAb+ and LRP4 Ab+ subgroups of MG patients rely on the comple-\\nment system activation, they can be successfully treated with\\ncomplement inhibitors such as eculizumab. The severity of MG\\nhas been related to the level of C5a, indicating that a blockade\\nof C5 can halt the complement cascade that disrupts the neuro-\\nmuscular\\ncommunication.(p39)\\nAlthough\\nthe\\ninitial\\ntrials\\nreported no signiﬁcant improvement of the primary endpoint\\n(MG-ADL scores), they found it improved symptoms and allevi-\\nated disease progression.(p40),(p41) Later studies discovered that\\ntreatment sustained for 2 years yielded fast and sustained\\nimprovements in muscle strength and quality of life of MG\\npatients.(p42),(p43) The cessation of treatment should be treated\\nwith caution, because the severe worsening of symptoms has\\nbeen observed after eculizumab discontinuation.(p44) Results\\nfrom the REGAIN open study suggested that most MG patients\\ndemonstrated signs of improvements after 12 weeks but in some\\ncases\\nresponses\\ncould\\nonly\\nbe\\nobserved\\nwith\\nlonger\\ntreatment.(p45)\\nAQP4-IgG+ neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder\\nNMOSD is a rare autoimmune disease of the CNS characterized\\nby severe attacks of inﬂammation and demyelination. It affects\\n\\x013.9–10.0\\nin\\n100\\n000\\npeople\\nand\\nthe\\ndisease\\nis\\nup\\nto\\nnine-times more common in women.(p46),(p47) NMOSD primarily\\naffects the optic nerves and spinal cord, leading to severe visual\\nimpairment and paralysis. In recent years, the discovery of a\\nspeciﬁc\\nbiomarker,\\naquaporin-4\\nimmunoglobulin\\nG\\n(AQP4-IgG), has revolutionized our understanding and diagnosis\\nof this condition.(p48) AQP4-IgG antibodies target the aquaporin-\\n4 water channel protein, which is predominantly expressed on\\nthe astrocytic endfeet in the CNS. This binding triggers an\\nimmune response and leads to inﬂammation and damage to\\nastrocytes, oligodendrocytes and neurons.(p49) The formation of\\nlesions in distinct brain regions with high AQP-4 expression is\\nalso\\none\\nof\\nthe\\ndeﬁning\\ncharacteristics\\nof\\nAQP4-IgG+\\nNMOSD.(p50),(p51),(p52) The clinical course of NMOSD is highly\\nvariable, with relapses occurring unpredictably, and the triggers\\nfor these relapses can include infections, surgery or pregnancy.\\nAs a result, diagnoses rely on clinical presentation, neuroimaging\\nand the presence of AQP4-IgG antibodies in the serum.(p53)\\nTherapeutic strategies for NMOSD primarily aim to prevent\\nrelapses and manage symptoms.(p54) Acute attacks are often trea-\\nted with high-dose corticosteroids and plasma exchange.(p55)\\nLong-term maintenance treatment usually consists of immuno-\\nsuppressive agents like rituximab, mitoxantrone and eculizumab\\nand these have shown efﬁcacy in reducing relapse rates and\\nseverity.(p56),(p57),(p58) Complement inhibitors are effective in\\nthe prevention of neuronal injury because AQP4-IgG has been\\ndemonstrated to activate the complement cascade.(p59) In PRE-\\nVENT, a randomized double-blind phase III clinical trial, eculizu-\\nmab reduced the symptoms and disease progression signiﬁcantly\\nin up to 96% of the patients. Only 3% of the patients experi-\\nenced relapse compared with 43% in the placebo control group.\\nIn addition, patients reported no worsening of their disabilities\\nas well as a signiﬁcant increase in quality of life during the\\nmedian follow-up period of 2.8 years.(p58),(p60),(p61),(p62)\\nOff-label uses\\nBesides the four abovementioned FDA and EMA licensed indica-\\ntions, eculizumab has been reported to be effective for several off-\\nlabel uses, one of which being the treatment of severe COVID-19\\ncases. Severe COVID-19 infections led to extensive lung damage\\nand organ failures and several parts of the complement system\\nhave been implicated in the pathogenesis.(p63),(p64),(p65) Several\\nsmall-scale studies treated severe COVID-19 patients with eculi-\\nzumab and reported signiﬁcant improvements in respiratory\\nsymptoms and radiographic pulmonary lesions, chronic compli-\\ncations and mortality.(p66),(p67),(p68) These studies suggest the pos-\\nsibility of eculizumab treatment in COVID-19 patients with\\nsevere respiratory diseases.

Small-scale cohorts of C3 glomerulopathy that were started\\non eculizumab reported mixed results. One study in 2018 found\\nstable outcomes for four out of seven patients, whereas a later\\nstudy reported only a good response for ﬁve out of 11\\npatients.(p70),(p71)\\nMechanism of action\\nThe complement system is a crucial part of the innate immune\\nsystem. It consists of a complex network of soluble proteins\\nand membrane-bound receptors the primary functions of which\\nare to recognize and eliminate pathogens, immune complexes\\nand damaged host cells. Complement activation occurs through\\nthree distinct pathways: the classical, alternative and lectin path-\\nways. Regardless of the initiation pathway, all pathways con-\\nverge at one central event, known as the C3 convertase\\nformation. The C3 convertase enzymatically cleaves the C3 pro-\\ntein into C3a and C3b. C3b further contributes to the formation\\nof C5 convertases, which are then responsible for cleaving C5\\ninto its active fragments: C5a and C5b. C5 is a pivotal protein\\nin the complement cascade. Once activated, it undergoes enzy-\\nmatic cleavage into C5a and C5b. C5a serves as a potent inﬂam-\\nmatory mediator, attracting immune cells to the site of infection\\nor injury. By contrast, C5b can associate with C6, C7, C8 and C9\\nto initiate the formation of the MAC, a multiprotein complex\\nthat can puncture and destroy cell membranes. Although this\\nprocess is crucial for eliminating pathogens, atypical or uncon-\\ntrolled complement activation can lead to extensive tissue\\ndamage.\\nEculizumab, developed from the murine antibody 5G1.1,\\nachieves its therapeutic effect by binding speciﬁcally to the C5\\nprotein. This binding interaction is highly speciﬁc to the N-\\nterminal region of the a-chain of the C5 protein. Speciﬁcally,\\neculizumab has been introduced to peptide fragments derived\\nfrom the human C5 protein that contained the KSSKC motif\\n(residues\\n879–883)\\nwithin\\nthe\\nalpha2-macroglobulin-like\\ndomain 7 (MG7). This motif is found distal to the location where\\nthe C5-convertase binds and proteolytically cleaves C5 into C5a\\nand C5b.(p72) The structural basis of eculizumab binding was elu-\\ncidated by X-ray crystal studies of C5 and it was suggested that\\nthe binding of C5 to the noncatalytic subunit of C5-convertase\\nundergoing steric hindrance after eculizumab binding was the\\nsuggested mechanism for complement inhibition.(p73) Addition-\\nally, several polymorphisms in this region (residue 885) have\\nbeen reported to signiﬁcantly alter the efﬁcacy of eculizumab,\\nproviding further evidence that the antibody binds in this\\nregion.(p74),(p75) The binding of eculizumab to this region pre-\\nvents C5 from undergoing cleavage and activation, effectively\\nneutralizing the complement protein.(p11)\\nBy binding to C5, eculizumab disrupts the cascade of comple-\\nment activation as can be seen in Figure 1. This prevents the for-\\nmation of C5a, the potent inﬂammatory mediator. C5a normally\\nattracts immune cells, such as neutrophils and macrophages, to\\nthe site of complement activation, leading to inﬂammation\\nand potential tissue damage. Eculizumab’s inhibition of C5a pro-\\nduction thus helps dampen the excessive inﬂammation seen in\\ncomplement-mediated diseases. Eculizumab’s interaction with\\nC5 also has another important consequence: it prevents the\\nformation of the MAC. By inhibiting the cleavage of C5 into\\nC5b, eculizumab effectively halts the initiation of the MAC\\nassembly process, protecting host cells from destruction. Eculizu-\\nmab has a very high speciﬁcity to human C5 (30–120 pM), with a\\nmuch lower afﬁnity for the protein of other species. This was sug-\\ngested to be the result of a Trp917Ser substitution in a large vari-\\nety of other species.(p73) Although eculizumab has a highly\\nspeciﬁc binding afﬁnity for C5, some evidence suggests that it\\ncan alter the serum proteometabolome. The inhibition of C5\\nresults in downregulated leukotrienes through arachidonate\\n5-lipoxygenase (ALOX5) modulation, which can result in altered\\nregulation of immune cell activity and bronchoconstriction.(p76)\\nPharmacokinetics\\nBecause eculizumab is a monoclonal human antibody, it shares\\nmany kinetic characteristics with other antibodies. The adminis-\\ntration of eculizumab occurs through weekly intravenous infu-\\nsions of 25–45 min in the loading phase, followed by biweekly\\ninfusions in the maintenance phase.(p77) The mean volume of\\ndistribution was estimated to be in the range of 80–110.3\\nml/kg,\\nindicating\\nthat\\nit\\nis\\nprimarily\\ndistributed\\nin\\nthe\\nplasma.(p78),(p79),(p80) The mean concentration of eculizumab in\\nthe CSF was measured in a small sample and the ratio between\\nserum and CSF was reported to be 5000:1, indicating that eculi-\\nzumab does not easily cross the blood–brain barrier.(p58)\\nEculizumab is an IgG antibody, and it is metabolized by con-\\ntinual nonspeciﬁc pinocytosis by endothelial cells, similar to\\nother IgG antibodies. This process happens with bound and\\nunbound C5 proteins in the plasma. After pinocytosis, eculizu-\\nmab can either be degraded in the lysosomes or it can be recycled\\nvia the binding to the neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn). However, the\\neculizumab–C5 complex is probably not dissociated efﬁciently in\\nthe\\nendosomes,\\npointing\\ntoward\\nthe\\nprimary\\nmetabolism\\nthrough target-mediated drug disposition (TMDD).(p81) The\\nEMA and FDA reported no known active eculizumab metabo-\\nlites.(p1),(p77) The half-life of eculizumab varies signiﬁcantly with\\nstudies reporting a range between 97 and 378 h.(p78),(p80) Because\\nthe molecular size of eculizumab is rather large (148 kDa) it is\\nunlikely to be excreted in urine. However, in patients with high\\ndegrees of proteinuria signiﬁcant levels of eculizumab (56 mg/ml)\\nwere measured.(p82),(p83) The clearance rate of eculizumab was\\nestimated to be in the range of 0.13–0.31 ml/h/kg.(p78),(p79),(p80)\\nOwing to the highly intra-individual variance of clearance and\\nvolume of distribution, it is recommended that the treatment\\nplans\\nare\\ntailored\\nto\\nindividual\\npatients.\\nIndividualized\\napproaches to eculizumab have been demonstrated to be cost-\\neffective and patient friendly.(p79),(p80),(p84)\\nAdverse drug reactions\\nAlthough this therapeutic agent has demonstrated signiﬁcant\\nefﬁcacy in managing rare and life-threatening conditions, it is\\nnot without its side effects. As a complement inhibitor, eculizu-\\nmab targets the innate immune system and this leaves users of\\nthe drug susceptible to certain infections such as Neisseria, pneu-\\nmonia and bacteremia.(p78),(p85) Eculizumab is generally well tol-\\nerated and safe and the most common side effects reported\\ninclude\\nhemoglobin\\ndecrease,\\nfatigue,\\npyrexia,\\nheadache,\\nKEYNOTE (GREEN)\\nKEYNOTE (GREEN)\\nKEYNOTE (GREEN)\\nDrug Discovery Today d Volume 29, Number 9 d September 2024\\n4\\nwww.drugdiscoverytoday.com'),\n",

Eculizumab binds to C5 so that cleavage into the\\nsubcomponents is prevented by steric hindrance. Ultimately, eculizumab inhibits the MAC formation resulting in the diminished hemolysis of cells.

Recent reports have demonstrated an iron overload\\nin the reticuloendothelial system (RES) of PNH patients treated\\nwith eculizumab.(p101),(p102),(p103) This is hypothesized to be\\ncaused by a decline in renal iron loss and due to ongoing\\nextravascular hemolysis.

The variability in\\nresponse to eculizumab could be explained by differences in\\nexpression of CR1 or factor-H-binding sites on red blood\\ncells.(p114) Despite increased anemia and transfusion depen-\\ndence, all patients with increased EVH still reported reduction\\nin\\ntransfusion\\nindependence.(p105),(p114),(p115),(p116)\\nAnother\\nmechanism for ineffective eculizumab treatment is resistance\\nthrough C5 polymorphisms.

The\\nLDH concentration was unchanged despite sustained eculizu-\\nmab concentration in the serum.(p119),(p120) A follow-up report\\nby Nishimura et al. in 2014 sought to investigate the molecular\\nbasis for the poor response in Japanese PNH patients. The blood\\nof the two patients in the AEGIS trial was further analyzed and\\nhemolysis indeed remained exceedingly high, similarly to the\\nLDH concentration predicted in the earlier report. An in vitro\\nexperiment demonstrated no discernable inhibition of hemoly-\\nsis\\nwith\\nserum\\neculizumab\\nconcentrations\\nas\\nhigh\\nas\\n2000 mg/ml, where a healthy control and a good responder to\\neculizumab required only 6.25 mg/ml and 12.5 mg/ml for com-\\nplete inhibition of hemolytic activity. Interestingly, the N19-8\\nantibody that binds to C5 in a different position to eculizumab\\ndemonstrated an inhibition of complement-mediated hemolysis\\nat similar concentrations for the healthy control, as well as the\\ngood and poor eculizumab responders.\\nTo identify the genetic variants responsible for the differences\\nin treatment response, all 41 exons of the C5 gene were\\nsequenced,\\nafter\\nwhich\\nthey\\nidentiﬁed\\na\\nsingle\\nmissense\\nheterozygous mutation in exon 21.

A similar allele frequency was found in 288\\nhealthy Japanese people (3.5%) but the mutation was found less\\nfrequently in Han Chinese (0.8%), British (0%) and Mexican\\n(0%) populations. An Argentinian patient responding poorly to\\neculizumab\\ntreatment\\nwith\\na\\nnew\\nmutation\\nc.2653C?T\\n(predicting p.Arg885Cys) was reported but this mutation was\\nnot detected in patients of Chinese Han, British or Mexican ori-\\ngin. The mechanism of poor response was conﬁrmed by generat-\\ning recombinant nonmutant human C5 (rC5) and mutant C5\\n(rC5m). Eculizumab blocked the classical pathway lysis with\\nrC5 in C5-depleted serum and was not able to block the pathway\\nin serum with rC5m as expected. Additionally, no detected bind-\\ning of eculizumab to rC5m was reported even with concentra-\\ntions up to 1 mM.(p74)\\nIn 2015, Langemeijer et al. presented the ﬁrst non-Asian case\\nreport of a 30-year-old Caucasian man with PNH who was started\\non eculizumab 4 years after diagnosis. Although the patient sus-\\ntained sufﬁcient drug levels and no HAHA antibodies were dis-\\ncovered in the serum, he still suffered from severe hemolysis\\nwith high LDH levels, extreme fatigue and muscle dystonia.\\nThe symptoms seemed to improve initially. However, several\\nmonths into the treatment after an episode of extreme hemoly-\\nsis, and one day after receiving 900 mg eculizumab, treatment\\nwas discontinued.

In 2019, a fourth report of a patient\\nwith the c.2654G?A mutation was reported by Lee et al. in an\\nopen-label Phase III study comparing the effects of eculizumab\\nand ravulizumab – a new C5 inhibitor. The comparison study\\nemployed 121 participants for eculizumab and 125 for ravulizu-\\nmab for a total of 246 participants. In the subgroup of 129 Asian\\nparticipants, one patient from South Korea presented with the\\np.Arg885His heterozygous missense mutation that caused poor\\neculizumab binding. Although the patient was in the ravulizu-\\nmab group, there was no clinical response reported, suggesting\\nthat\\nravulizumab\\nbinds\\nto\\na\\nsimilar\\nC5\\nregion\\nas\\neculizumab.(p118) Zilucoplan is a C5 cleavage inhibitor that has\\nbeen recently indicated for MG. It has been shown to inhibit\\nhemolysis induced by the p.Arg885His C5 variant which ren-\\ndered eculizumab ineffective, making this a suitable treatment\\nfor gMG patients with C5 polymorphisms.(p133)\\nIn total, three different types of C5 polymorphisms have been\\ndiscovered that bring about poor responses to eculizumab treat-\\nment.

The Fab–C5 complex was puri-\\nﬁed and then crystallized to generate the X-ray diffraction data\\nneeded to elucidate the structure of the complex. They found\\nthat the poor response of patients with an Arg885His or\\nArg885Cys polymorphism could be caused by a disruption in\\nthe binding location of C5 and eculizumab. The histidine or\\ncysteine groups are probably too small to ﬁll the arginine-\\nbinding pocket of eculizumab, leading to a loss of afﬁnity. Addi-\\ntionally, the arginine is located close to a disulﬁde bridge\\nresulting in a possibly perturbed disulﬁde bridge pattern owing\\nto the Arg885Cys polymorphism.

To date, no pharmacoeconomic\\nstudies have considered the economic beneﬁts or cost–utility of\\npredictive testing. Given the high treatment costs for eculizumab\\nof up to €500 000 per year and a relatively long treatment time\\nbefore switching to another treatment of up to 3 months, it\\ncould be ﬁnancially feasible to start genetic screening in certain\\npopulations (EMA, 2023). Complications can arise during the inef-\\nfective treatment, leading to potential increased costs owing to\\nhospital stays. Episodic crises are common in PNH, aHUS, MG\\nand AQP4+ NMOSD patients and the ﬁrst few weeks of treat-\\nment can be crucial to avoid complications that can lead to\\nmyocardial scars, organ failure, permanent disabilities and\\ndeath.(p13),(p142),(p143),(p144) As a result, genetic testing should not\\ncause treatment delays because this will also be harmful for\\nthe patient. The economic beneﬁts depend on the cost of alter-\\nnative treatments, however, and currently the alternative treat-\\nments\\nsuch\\nas\\npegcetacoplan\\nare\\nsimilar\\nin\\nprice\\nto\\neculizumab.(p145) Another factor that could negatively inﬂuence\\nthe beneﬁts of genetic screening is that the eculizumab user\\ngroup is small owing to the rarity of the indicated diseases.
